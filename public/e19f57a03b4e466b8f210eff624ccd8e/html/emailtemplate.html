                        <p>While Oxbow Lake members Chris Skene and Kyle Chervanik have a long and meandering musical history that stretches from their high school garage band days to the present day, they spent many of those years on parallel but separate musical paths. Each spent years spent making names for themselves as two of Tallahassee's most sought-after live performance session musicians, collaborating frequently under [someone else's guidance] and into recently burgeoning parallel careers as solo performers. But much like their namesake—an oxbow lake—is formed when a wide, looping section of a river gradually separates from the main flow of water, the duo have found themselves pulled more and more toward a project that exists apart from the constantly moving landscape of session work.

Now in their mid-20s, and with over two decades of combined experience playing hundreds of shows at venues throughout the Florida panhandle and deep south, the pair comes together to present [new music vision]. Driven both by admiration for the virtuosic playing of present-day greats like Derek Trucks, Oteil Burbridge, and Jimmy Herring, as well as a deep-seated affinity for the harmonic and rhythmic concordance of groups like the Band and Delaney and Bonnie. tight vocal harmonies, quality musicianship, and a shared musical aesthetic that runs from muscle shoals and motown to british invasion rock 'n' roll and west-coast alternative rock.
